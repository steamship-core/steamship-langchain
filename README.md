[Steamship](https://steamship.com/) is the fastest way to build, ship, and use full-lifecycle language AI.

This repository contains [LangChain](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) adapters for Steamship, enabling 
LangChain developers to rapidly deploy their apps on Steamship to automatically get:

- Production-ready API endpoint(s)
- Horizontal scaling across dependencies / backends
- Persistent storage of app state (including caches)
- Built-in support for Authn/z 
- Multi-tenancy support
- Seamless integration with other Steamship skills (ex: audio transcription) 
- Usage Metrics and Logging
- And more...

Read more about Steamship and LangChain on our [website](https://www.steamship.com/build/langchain-apps?utm_source=github&utm_medium=explainer&utm_campaign=github_repo&utm_id=github_langchain_repo). 

## Installing

Install via pip:

```commandline
pip install steamship-langchain
```

## Adapters

Initial support is offered for the following (with more to follow soon):
- LLMs
  - An adapter is provided for Steamship's OpenAI integration (`steamship_langchain.llms.OpenAI`)
  - An adapter is provided for *caching* LLM calls, via Steamship's Key-Value store (`SteamshipCache`) 
- Callbacks
  - A callback that uses Python's `logging` module to record events is provided (`steamship_langchain.callbacks.LoggingCallbackHandler`). This can be used with `ship logs` to access verbose logs when deployed.
- Document Loaders
  - An adapter for exporting Steamship Files as LangChain Documents is provided (`steamship_langchain.document_loaders.SteamshipLoader`)
- Tools
  - Search:
    - An adapter is provided for Steamship's SERPAPI integration (`SteamshipSERP`)
- Memory
  - Chat History (`steamship_langchain.memory.ChatMessageHistory`)
- VectorStores
  - An adapter is provided for a persistent VectorStore (`steamship_langchain.vectorstores.SteamshipVectorStore`)
- Text Splitters
  - A splitter for Python code, based on the AST, is provided (`steamship_langchain.python_splitter.PythonCodeSplitter`). This provides additional context for code snippets (parent classes) while breaking the code into segments around function definitions.
- Miscellaneous Utilities
  - Importing data into Steamship
    - In order to take advantage of Steamship's persistent storage, an initial set of loader utilities are provided for a variety of sources, including:
      - Text files: `steamship_langchain.file_loaders.TextFileLoader`
      - Directories: `steamship_langchain.file_loaders.DirectoryLoader`
      - GitHub repositories: `steamship_langchain.file_loaders.GitHubRepositoryLoader`
      - Sphinx documentation sites: `steamship_langchain.file_loaders.SphinxSiteLoader` (and others)
      - YouTube videos: `steamship_langchain.file_loaders.YouTubeFileLoader`
      - Various text and image formats: `steamship_langchain.file_loaders.UnstructuredFileLoader`

## 📖 Documentation
Please see our [here](https://steamship-langchain.readthedocs.org/) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)
- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

## Example Use Cases

Here are a few examples of using LangChain on Steamship:
- [Basic Prompting](#basic-prompting)
- [Self Ask With Search](#self-ask-with-search)
- [ChatBot](#chatbot)
- [Summarize Audio](#summarize-audio--async-chaining-)
- [Question Answering With Sources](#question-answering-with-sources--embeddings-)

The examples use temporary workspaces to provide full cleanup during experimentation.
[Workspaces](https://docs.steamship.com/workspaces/index.html) provide a unit of tenant isolation within Steamship.
For production uses, persistent workspaces can be created and retrieved via `Steamship(workspace_handle="my_workspace")` .

> **NOTE**
> These examples omit `import` blocks. Please consult the `examples/` directory for complete source code. 

> **NOTE** 
> Client examples assume that the user has a Steamship API key and that it is exposed to the environment (see: [API Keys](#api-keys))

This provides an example of using LangChain to process audio transcriptions
obtained via Steamship's speech-to-text plugins (full source: [examples/summarize-audio](./examples/summarize-audio))

A brief introduction to the Task system (and Task dependencies, for chaining) is
provided in this example. Here, we use `task.wait()` style polling, but time-based
`task.refresh()` style polling, etc., is also available.

#### Server Snippet
```python
from steamship_langchain.llms import OpenAI

@post("summarize_file")
def summarize_file(self, file_handle: str) -> str:
    file = File.get(self.client, handle=file_handle)
    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter()
    texts = []
    for block in file.blocks:
        texts.extend(text_splitter.split_text(block.text))
    docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts]
    llm = OpenAI(client=self.client, cache=True)
    chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type="map_reduce")
    return chain.run(docs)

@post("summarize_audio_file")
def summarize_audio_file(self, audio_file_handle: str) -> Task[str]:
    transcriber = self.client.use_plugin("whisper-s2t-blockifier")
    audio_file = File.get(self.client, handle=audio_file_handle)
    transcribe_task = audio_file.blockify(plugin_instance=transcriber.handle)
    return self.invoke_later("summarize_file", wait_on_tasks=[transcribe_task], arguments={"file_handle": audio_file.handle})
```

    if summarize_task.state == TaskState.succeeded:
      summary = base64.b64decode(summarize_task.output).decode("utf-8")
      print(f"Summary: {summary.strip()}")
```

### Question Answering with Sources (Embeddings)

Provides a basic example of using Steamship to manage embeddings and power a LangChain agent
for question answering with sources (full source: [examples/qa_with_sources](./examples/qa_with_sources))

> **NOTE** 
> The embeddings will persist for the lifetime of the Workspace.

    # Upload the State of the Union address
    with open("state_of_the_union.txt") as f:

    print(f"Answer: {response['result'].strip()}")
```

## API Keys

Steamship API Keys provide access to our SDK for AI models, including OpenAI, GPT, Cohere, Whisper, and more.

Get your free API key here: https://steamship.com/account/api.

Once you have an API Key, you can :
* Set the env var `STEAMSHIP_API_KEY` for your client
* Pass it directly via `Steamship(api_key=)` or `Steamship.tempory_workspace(api_key=)`.

Alternatively, you can run `ship login`, which will guide you through setting up your environment.

## Deploying on Steamship

Deploying LangChain apps on Steamship is simple: `ship it`.

From your package directory (where your `api.py` lives), you can issue the `ship it` command to generate a manifest file and push your package to Steamship. You may then use the Steamship SDK to create instances of your package in Workspaces as best fits your needs.

More on deployment and Workspaces can be found in [our docs](https://docs.steamship.com/).
