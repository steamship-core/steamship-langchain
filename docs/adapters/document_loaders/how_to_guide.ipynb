    "# How-To Guide: Steamship Loader\n",
    "This is an example of using the Steamship Loader to export Steamship File's to Documents for use in LangChain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will create a temporary workspace and load a local file into that workspace to simulate a production Steamship workspace. We will use the File Loader utilities included in `steamship-langchain` for this purpose. We will associate an import ID with our import to allow for demonstration of the query-based loading capabilities of `SteamshipLoader`. Including extra metadata is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real usage, you would use a persistent workspace and the files would live permanently in that workspace. This would allow creation of Steamship Files to take place over time (via File Importer plugins, client-side uploads, etc.)."
